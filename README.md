# Helpr-19

This readme will be changed to an actual readme pretty soon, but this is just the info that everyone should know which I didn't want to send into the facebook gc:

1. If you haven't already, check out the google doc we have:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1jWfW25PjDT3L9ElvkTDAqS0ugLIao6nf6PkHTR5os/edit?usp=sharing
2. If anyone has cloud computing credits or knows where we could get some, let Max know
3. We will roughly be using agile software development to do our work. Basically we will have cards in the "projects" tab of our repo and each card will represent a task that needs to be done. Put your name on a card and move it to whatever column it needs to be in while you do your work. (ask Max if you have any questions about it.
4. Have fun and learn a lot! I'm super excited about this project idea (THANK YOU CHRIS) and I think we can do a lot with it in the time we have!
